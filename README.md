# Testes-Basicos-Com-Cypress

A sample project to demostrate a few uses for some of the most common cypress features.

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests 

You can run the tests simulating a desktop or a mobile viewport
### Desktop 

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode.
